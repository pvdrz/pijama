# Understand how to compile code to an executable file

Code generation will be restricted to Linux in `x86_64` for now. I need to
understand how to compile my own executable, given that I don't have the
knowledge to do this from scratch, I'm going to piggy back on top of `clang` to
achieve this. The plan would be to produce a `lib.o` object file that clang can
use to link against a simple `main.c` file that calls an extern function and
prints it's return value. The object file should provide this extern function.

So to figure out how this `lib.o` should look like we will start by writing a
`lib.c` first and create an object file from it:
```bash
$ clang -c lib.c
```

This should create a `lib.o` object file. Then we can link `main.c` against it.
```bash
$ clang main.c lib.o
```

Now we should have an `a.out` executable.
